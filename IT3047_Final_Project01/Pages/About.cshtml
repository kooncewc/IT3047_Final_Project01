  <p>I love to watch movies with my family and friends. Whenever a new movie comes out in theatres, 
    I try my best to watch it during opening night. My favorite movie that I saw in theatres was 
    Avengers: Infinity War. It is crazy to think that it took 10 years to build up to Avengers: Infinity War. 
    I remember trying my best to avoid any spoilers before watching the movie. I was so excited and nervous 
    because I had no idea what was going to happen. I will never forget walking out of the movie theatre 
    speechless and having to wait another year for part 2. I am happy to have experienced this movie in theatres.  </p>
